# You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?

It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?

__'m nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.__ *I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt.* *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

## I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.

I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. You hit me with a cricket bat. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?

1. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
2. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!
3. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.

### Saving the world with meals on wheels.

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Saving the world with meals on wheels. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

* Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.
* You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!
* You've swallowed a planet!

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!

I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! You hit me with a cricket bat. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

You've swallowed a planet! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
